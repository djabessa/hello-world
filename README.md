# hello-world
New to contributing here on Github and I would love to observe and try a little bit of my own coding to help me improve my coding,
I am a senior in college at George Mason Universtiy. I love learning new coding languages and hope to contribute and decode any issues with coding specifically java at the moment. I am also learning some php and html and css and jquery. I hope to become at app developer in the process as well thru my new understanding of swift in the process as well.
